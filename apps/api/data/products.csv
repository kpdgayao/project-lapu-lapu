Off-label: psychotic symptoms, aggression in dementia, Tourette syndrome.","Schizophrenia adults: Start 2mg/day (divided or once daily), target 4-8mg/day. Bipolar mania: Start 2-3mg/day. Autism irritability: 0.25-0.5mg/day initially. Adjust based on response and tolerability. May take with or without food.",,"Generally better tolerability profile than first-generation antipsychotics. May be used in children with autism for irritability management (aggression, self-injury, tantrums). Take consistently at same time each day.

Reone,Risperidone,Atypical Antipsychotic / Second-Generation Antipsychotic,1mg (30 tablets),930,744,Antipsychotic,"Reone (Risperidone) is a second-generation antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism. It effectively manages psychotic symptoms and mood disturbances through balanced dopamine and serotonin receptor modulation, with applications across multiple age groups.","Acts as an antagonist at dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors with high affinity for both. The balanced antagonism at these receptors helps control positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal, lack of motivation, flat affect) of schizophrenia while maintaining a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms compared to first-generation antipsychotics. Also blocks alpha-1 adrenergic and H1 histamine receptors.","Schizophrenia in adults and adolescents (13+).

Conjupram,Escitalopram,Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) / Antidepressant,10mg (1 box),1750,1400,Antidepressant,"Conjupram (Escitalopram) is a highly selective SSRI antidepressant with superior efficacy and tolerability among its class. It is the pure S-enantiomer of citalopram, approximately 150 times more potent than the R-enantiomer, providing effective treatment for depression and multiple anxiety disorders with minimal off-target effects and faster onset of action.","Selectively blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT) at both the orthosteric (primary) binding site and an allosteric site, preventing serotonin reuptake into presynaptic neurons. This dual binding increases the rate of serotonin blockade and prolongs its duration. Increased synaptic serotonin availability gradually restores normal mood regulation and reduces anxiety. Escitalopram has the highest selectivity for SERT among all SSRIs (selectivity ratio >1000:1 for SERT vs NET), contributing to its favorable side effect profile.","Major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).","Initial: 10mg once daily (morning or evening). May increase to 20mg daily after minimum 1 week if needed. Elderly/hepatic impairment: Maximum 10mg daily. Take same time each day, with or without food. Swallow whole with water.",,"Full therapeutic effect may take 4-6 weeks, though some improvement may be seen in 1-2 weeks. Among SSRIs, escitalopram shows superior efficacy and faster onset of action compared to citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline in meta-analyses. Generally well-tolerated with lower discontinuation rates due to adverse effects. Do not stop abruptly - gradual tapering over 1-2 weeks minimum required to prevent discontinuation syndrome.",Concurrent use with MAOIs (allow 14-day washout period) or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs. Concurrent use with pimozide. Hypersensitivity to escitalopram or citalopram.,"Black box warning: May increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (18-24) during initial treatment - close monitoring required especially first few weeks. Risk of serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with other serotonergic drugs (tramadol, triptans, other antidepressants, St. John's Wort). May cause sexual dysfunction (delayed ejaculation, decreased libido, anorgasmia), weight changes, insomnia or drowsiness, nausea, headache. May cause QT prolongation at doses above 20mg. Avoid alcohol. May increase bleeding risk, especially with NSAIDs or anticoagulants. Use caution in bipolar disorder - may precipitate manic episode. Gradual discontinuation needed to prevent withdrawal symptoms (dizziness, nausea, headache, irritability, sensory disturbances)."
Clopifar,Clopidogrel,Antiplatelet Agent / P2Y12 Inhibitor / Thienopyridine,75mg (30 tablets),1450,1160,Antiplatelet,"Clopifar (Clopidogrel) is an irreversible antiplatelet medication that prevents blood clot formation, significantly reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease. It works by permanently blocking platelet activation, providing sustained cardiovascular protection and improving outcomes in patients with atherothrombotic disease.","Irreversibly inhibits the platelet P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, preventing ADP-induced platelet activation and aggregation. This blocks the activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor complex, which normally binds fibrinogen to connect and aggregate platelets. As a prodrug, clopidogrel requires activation by CYP enzymes (primarily CYP2C19, also CYP3A4) through a 2-step bioactivation process to its active thiol metabolite. Once activated, it permanently modifies the P2Y12 receptor for the platelet's lifespan (7-10 days).","Prevention of atherothrombotic events: recent myocardial infarction (heart attack), recent ischemic stroke, established peripheral arterial disease. Acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI with or without fibrinolysis). Prevention of stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease.","Standard maintenance: 75mg once daily. Acute coronary syndrome: 300-600mg loading dose, then 75mg daily. STEMI: 75mg daily (may give 300mg loading if age ≤75). Continue indefinitely unless bleeding risk outweighs benefit. Take with or without food, same time daily.",,"Reduces risk of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke by approximately 20% compared to aspirin alone. Platelet inhibition occurs within 2 hours of loading dose, with steady-state reached in 3-7 days with daily dosing. Antiplatelet effects persist for 5-7 days after discontinuation (platelet lifespan). Typically combined with aspirin (dual antiplatelet therapy/DAPT) after stent placement - continue DAPT for recommended duration (1-12 months depending on stent type and bleeding risk). Inform all healthcare providers and dentists you are taking this medication before any procedure or surgery.","Active pathological bleeding (active peptic ulcer, intracranial hemorrhage). Hypersensitivity to clopidogrel or any component.","Increased bleeding risk - report unusual bleeding, bruising, blood in urine/stool, severe headache, or signs of GI bleeding. Do not discontinue without consulting physician, especially within first year after stent placement (risk of stent thrombosis with MI/death). Reduced efficacy in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (2-14% of population, higher in Asians) - genetic testing may be considered for high-risk patients; alternative agents (prasugrel, ticagrelor) may be preferred. Increased risk of thrombotic events if stopped prematurely. May cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) - rare but serious. Avoid concurrent use with omeprazole or esomeprazole (reduce clopidogrel effectiveness). Use caution with drugs that increase bleeding risk (anticoagulants, NSAIDs). Inform surgeon before elective surgery - may need to discontinue 5-7 days prior depending on procedure and bleeding risk."
